## Programming Exercise

The exercise we’d like to see is to use the NASA API described [here](https://api.nasa.gov) to build a project in GitHub that calls the Mars Rover API and selects a picture on a given day. We want your application to download and store each image locally.

Here is an <https://github.com/jlowery457/nasa-exercise | example> of this exercise done by one of our senior developers.  This is the level of effort we are looking for from someone who wants to join the LAO development team.  

### Acceptance Criteria
* Please send a link to the GitHub repo via <matt.hawkes@livingasone.com> when you are complete.

    * June 2, 2018

    * April 31, 2018
* Language needs to be *Java*.
* We should be able to run and build (if applicable) locally after you submit it
* Include relevant documentation (.MD, etc.) in the repo

### Bonus 
* Bonus - Unit Tests, Static Analysis, Performance tests or any other things you feel are important for Definition of Done
* Double Bonus - Have the app display the image in a web browser
* Triple Bonus – Have it run in a Docker or K8s (Preferable)
